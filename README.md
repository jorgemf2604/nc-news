<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## 🚧 About The Project

This is a project created for the Northcoders Bootcamp. I am trying to mimic the building of a news service (such as reddit). This front-end architecture made in React will be using the data provided for my API (code hosted in another repo).

Link to hosted version of the front-end: https://jorge-nc-news.netlify.app/

Link to the hosted version of the back-end: https://be-nc-news-oefr.onrender.com/api

Link to the back-end application repo: https://github.com/jorgemf2604/be-nc-news

## 💿 Requirements

![made-with-react](https://img.shields.io/badge/Made%20with-React-blue?style=for-the-badge&logo=appveyor)

The following dependencies are used for the front-end of this project. Yow will need to install them if you want to run the app locally:

dependencies:

- "@testing-library/jest-dom": "^5.16.5",
- "@testing-library/react": "^13.4.0",
- "@testing-library/user-event": "^13.5.0",
- "axios": "^1.3.5",
- "react": "^18.2.0",
- "react-dom": "^18.2.0",
- "react-icons": "^4.8.0",
- "react-router-dom": "^6.10.0",
- "react-scripts": "5.0.1",
- "react-toastify": "^9.1.2",
- "web-vitals": "^2.1.4"

The back-end is a node application so you will need to install it if it is not already in your computer. Having a look at the package-lock.json most of the of the packages require a node engine >=6.9.0 (although the node version installed in the machine I built this project is 19.3.0). Go to the back-end README.md if you want to know more.
